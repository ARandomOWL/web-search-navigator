# Google Search Navigator

This is a simple Google Chrome extension that enhances the keyboard navigation
in Google Search. Google provides an experimental keyboard navigation for search
results, but it's often broken for me (and [not just for
me](https://goo.gl/1zMkYu)).

Install from the [Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/enhanced-keyboard-navigat/cohamjploocgoejdfanacfgkhjkhdkek)

## Keybindings

*   `↓`/`j`: Select next search result
*   `↑`/`k`: Select previous previous result
*   `/`: Focus on input search box
*   `Enter`/`Space`: Navigate to selected result
*   `Ctrl+Enter`/`⌘+Enter`/`Ctrl+Space`: Open selected result in new tab/window

## TODO

*   Add animated gif showing how this extension works
*   Remove Keymaster dependency and add functions for validation user provided
    Keybindings
