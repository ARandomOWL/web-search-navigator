# Enhanced keyboard navigation in Google Search

This is a very simple Google Chrome extension that enhances the keyboard
navigation in Google Search. Google provides an experimental keyboard navigation
for search results, but it's often broken for me (and [not just for
  me](https://goo.gl/1zMkYu)).

## Keybindings

* `↓`: Select next search result
* `↑`: Select previous previous result
* `/`: Focus on input search box
* `Return`: Navigate to selected result
* `Ctrl/⌘+Return`: Open selected result in new tab/window

## Installation
