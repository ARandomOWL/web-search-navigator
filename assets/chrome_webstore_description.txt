New in 0.2.6 (not released):
* Keybindings for navigating between search result pages

Simple open source extension that enhances the keyboard navigation
in Google Search. Google used to provide an experimental keyboard navigation for
search results, but it was often broken (https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to
have been removed as of 2017-07-31 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).
In addition, I wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be
more vim like (j/k for navigation).

## Keybindings

*   `↓`/`j`: Select next search result
*   `↑`/`k`: Select previous previous result
*   `←`/`h`: Navigate to previous search result page
*   `→`/`l`: Navigate to next search result page
*   `/`/`Escape`: Focus on input search box
*   `Enter`/`Space`: Navigate to selected result
*   `Ctrl+Enter`/`⌘+Enter`/`Ctrl+Space`: Open selected result in new tab/window
*   `a`/`s`: Navigate to All tab (= default search tab)
*   `i`: Navigate to images tab
*   `v`: Navigate to videos tab
*   `m`: Navigate to maps tab
*   `n`: Navigate to news tab
