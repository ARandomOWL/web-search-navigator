## Overview

Simple open source extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to Google search™ and other websites.

See the latest changelog in https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

## Motivation

Google search™ used to provide experimental keyboard navigation, but it was often broken (https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to have been removed as of 2017-07-31 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).  In addition, I wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be more vim like (j/k for navigation).
