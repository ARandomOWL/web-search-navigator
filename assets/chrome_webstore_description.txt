Simple open source extension that enhances the keyboard navigation
in Google Search. Google used to provide an experimental keyboard navigation for
search results, but it was often broken (https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to
have been removed as of 2017-07-31 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).
In addition, I wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be
more vim like (j/k for navigation).
